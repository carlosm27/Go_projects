This directory has a file with go extension with the source code and executable file. This program ask you to write the name of a csv file including ".csv" and it shows you a dataframe of that file.
If the file doesn't exist, the program will ends.
The executable file has to be in a directory where csv files are stored.
I added two csv file just to test the program.
